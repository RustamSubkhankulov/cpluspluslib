My own simple implementation of STL (partly), including:

- vector as MyStd::Vector
- array  as MyStd::Array 
- exceptions as MyStd::Exception and EXCP macro 

It's important to note that EXCP work with my own simple log system( including some other macros and codegeneration)

All headers needed to use containers in <code>include</code> directory.
